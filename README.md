This is a public repo containing eagercrat 1.8.8 and 1.5.2.
I try to misspell the name as much as I can so that schools can't find and block certain terms.
If a term gets blocked or i forget to update the client, please complain about it as much as possible so I can fix it, though I highly recommend downloading the client if possible and keeping multiple copies of it under different filenames to make it harder to block.
